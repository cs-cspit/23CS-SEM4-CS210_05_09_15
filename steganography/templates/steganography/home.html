    <h1>Hello Agent, Welcome to <span class="logo-highlight">SPYVERSE</span></h1>
    <p>Scared your messages might get intercepted and blow your cover? <br>
    Relax. We've built something... stealthier than shadows.</p>
    <p>This is <strong>Steganography</strong> ‚Äî hiding your secrets inside ordinary files: images, audio, videos. 
    Not encryption. True invisibility.</p>
    <p>We do <strong>NOT</strong> collect or store your secrets.<br>
    We don't answer to governments. We don't answer to anyone. <br>
    We operate in the <span class="logo-highlight">Shadows</span>.</p>
    <p>‚û°Ô∏è To start a mission: go to <strong>UPLOAD</strong> and embed your message inside a decoy file.</p>
    <p>üõë Warning, comrade: <em>Send the file exactly as is</em>. No compression. No tampering. 
    Break this rule, and you might vanish into the bandit country... forever.</p>
    <p>üîç Received something suspicious? Go to <strong>DECODE</strong>. Enter the password. 
    Retrieve the intel ‚Äî if you still remember it.</p>
    <p><em>Good luck, agent. The world is watching. Stay hidden.</em></p>
